# Medium Market Research Reports
This scraper pulls titles, publish date, number of claps, author, and reading time based on tag input (ex. SEO, data-science) from Medium.com

However, I will not be uploading the scraper :)

I will upload a [12-month report based on the SEO](https://imjakedaniels.github.io/MediumScraper/) to showcase the capabilities.

I can generate these market research reports on any tag on Medium (ex. travel, SEO, freelance, blockchain, artifical intelligence) that produce clusters of topics using LDA, networks of correlated words using pairwise regression, and which buzzwords are good/bad at generating claps using vertices in igraph, plus more.

These are ideal reports to deliver to clients in these various industries. They showcase article virality, word performance, and content opportunities and the script/notebook scale.

Here's the report:
