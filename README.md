# Medium Market Research Reports

I have a scraper that's able to pull headers, claps, authors, urls, and reading time from any tag on Medium.com (ex. SEO, Artifical Intelligence, True Crime)
I'm then able to use the URLs and run a second scraper that pulls the full text for each article.

This has been packaged to deliver market research on the respective topics. It will be scaled to five years of articles. Then examined by contrasting the last year/six-months/three-months of data to deliver updated topics/trends based on correlations, popularity, and efficiency being discussed.

Please look at the report_output file and see a rough outline.
