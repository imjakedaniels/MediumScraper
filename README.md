# MediumScraper
This scraper pulls titles, publish date, number of claps, author, and reading time based on tag input (ex. SEO, data-science) from Medium.com

However, I will not be uploading it :)

I will be uploading a 6-month report based on the SEO to showcase the capabilities.

I can generate these market research reports on any tag on Medium (ex. travel, SEO, lifestyle) that produce clusters of topics using LDA, networks of correlated words using pairwise regression, and which buzzwords are good/bad at generating claps using vertices in igraph, plus more.

The reports will be for sale (3, 6, 12-months, or annual ex. 2017, 2018) -- there are approximately 5,000 articles every 3 months.

These are ideal reports to deliver to clients in their industries!
